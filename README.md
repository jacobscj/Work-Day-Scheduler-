# Work-Day-Scheduler-

The goal of this assignment was to create a simple work day calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The time blocks are color coded depending on their time relative to the current time of day. This assignment put to the test my new found knowledge of Jquery, bootstrap, and momentjs.
